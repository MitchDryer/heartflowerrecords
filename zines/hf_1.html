     <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">The word ‘realm’ describes a kind of
      semi physical, semi emotional space.</p>

      <p>Our day to day experience is really not
one of passing through physical spaces
but one of passing through realms
which include the constant and always
fluctuating emotional state of the body.
Neither the emotional state nor the
physical state ever exist independently;
you never perceive a space without an
emotional filter and an emotion is never
felt without a physical context. The more
clearly this is seen the more the seeming
duality of an internal and external world
begins to collapse and life becomes a
fluid singular experience. Because of
course it is only through interpretation
that we imagine ourselves to be at some
deep hidden place at the centre of our
experience interacting with an outside
world separate from ourselves. If we
allow ourselves to drop this interpretation
even for a moment we can find ourselves
in a place that no longer feels definable
as physical or non physical space but
maybe more suited to the label of realm.</p>

      <p>Freedom is maybe something like an
expansion of possibility or a collapsing
of inevitability. What once was defined
solid and real melts into a fluid field of
potential and you realise yourself as
the creative desire itself orchestrating
the unfolding. The pace of imagination
more closely matches the pace of doing
cognition more closely matches intuition
and the abstract is seen to be as real
as the real is seen to be abstract. These
qualities can be found in many areas
of life but especially in something like
a creative practice in relationship with
others or anything that induces some sort
of flow state. The resistances we face in
bringing creations into this world are in
essence the same resistances we face
when we attempt to create a better world
for ourselves, and by overcoming them in
our creative practice we move closer to
overcoming them in our day to day life.
Maybe ultimately an ongoing experience
of freedom is possible and by tasting it in
creative areas of our life we are learning
how to bring it into totality.
    </p>


      <p>A realm of freedom is then freedom
experienced not in a physical place or
an emotional state or someplace else
but as the totality of experience. In a
moment of true inspiration or creative
breakthrough not only does the creative
project experience freedom the ground
you stand on is seen to be freedom.</p>

      <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">The computer in front of you
is seen to be freedom the pains
of the body are seen to be
freedom and even the world
outside is seen to be freedom.</p>

      <p>Maybe it is a mistake to view our lives
as a compromise between work and
leisure or obligation and freedom
because when we enter into a realm
of freedom everything is liberated.</p>

    <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">the narrative/conceptual element of
this album is really cool. what is your
interpretation of the orb?</p>
    <p>the orb is a physical embodiment of the freedom
and liberation that the world so desperately
needs. it holds the potential to transform the
world and help it to access its truest state,
but in the album, the orb itself is imprisoned
in a tesseract of walls and unable to do this
transformative work, so it becomes the work
of the collective to set the orb free, and in
doing so allow everything and everyone else
to become free.</p>

    <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">this album covers a lot of sonic ground.
what musical influences do you think
made their way into BTO?</p>
    <p>daphnis et chloé by maurice ravel. there is
something so magical and otherworldly about
its choral sound and its peaks and swells of
intensity. i tried to bring a similar intensity and
vibe to the choir writing and overall sound of
the album. i listened to this recording and
pictured the orb in the early stages of this
project when i was at an emotional low, and
it felt so important to persist and transcend all
doubts - to put all the necessary life force into
making the album honour the orb itself.</p>
    <p>it’s time by max roach is such a bonkers album.
it influenced BEHOLD THE ORB, especially in
the way the choir and jazz quartet are integrated
together. the intro to sunday afternoon, the third
track on that album also inspired the intro to
break it free.</p>
    <p>i love the way the album purest form by james
francies uses ethereal reverby vocal and
synth sounds to create a dark and magical
world which brings the freaky modern jazz
improvisations into a new realm. especially the
unison vocals in the track 713. the titles also
really resonate with the vibe of BEHOLD THE
ORB - levitate, transfiguration, purest form all
evoke the kind of energy which the orb does.</p>
    <p>i’m always inspired by work coming out of the
LA creative jazz scene. henry solomon and
logan kane have lots of great solo records and
a project together called outside world. their
albums are always fearless curations which draw
from a wide sonic palette, but also all sound
so much like them. i like artists who have their
own vibe which transcends genre, or who can
make each musical element sound like them.
maximilian sink mastered their album outside
world 3 and i asked him to master BEHOLD
THE ORB as well. he did an amazing job making
my crazy sonically varied album sound unified.</p>
    <p>the song orbital rim was definitely inspired by
the dunedin sound, music from where i grew
up. especially asta rangu’s EP plasticine and my
friends’ band re:ruby who have a single out and
play around wellington a lot. i would listen to
plasticine a lot to try and get orbital rim closer
to that sort of mix. my dunedin friends approve
of that track so i feel it was a success.</p>
    <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">when you write music, how do
you balance taking inspiration from
other artists with finding inspiration
in yourself?</p>
    <p>i have a pretty specific taste but i’m learning
to appreciate music which does things in a way
i wouldn’t. i’m inspired by the elements of other
people’s work that i find strangest, most exciting,
novel, beautiful, authentic etc. i try and find
a home for the ones which resonate with me.
i’ve heard people subscribe to the notion that
there is nothing new under the sun but i’m
interested in conjuring up new sounds and
trying to disprove this theorem!</p>
    <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">the tracks with Frida are magical.
How was it writing and recording those?</p>
    <p>i wrote a lot of these in the weeks before the
quartet recording day, fueled by nervous energy
and excitement. i layered choir patches together
until i was happy with the sound, and moved
between writing on my midi keyboard and
drawing crazy chords with my computer mouse.
i don’t think about harmonic rules when i write
music, i just imagine what i want to hear and draw
from all the music i’ve listened to and loved as
well as embrace and curate the surprises which
emerge in the process.</p>
    <p>when i showed the songs to frida flacks she
instantly saw the vision, and elevated it to heights
beyond what i was imagining. frida captured the
emotional, transcendent, pained and ethereal in
all the right moments and harmonised a lot of my
melodies, intuitively adding voices layer by layer
in fresh and unexpected ways. we recorded her
vocals over the course of 3 sessions, DIY style
on my laptop and talked about the orb, cosmic
energy and transcendence over tea breaks. i feel
frida lifted the album to the next level. once the
vocals were added i felt ready to finish the album,
and spent a few weeks working obsessively on it
until it was done.</p>
    <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">the mix of a live jazz band with the
ethereal sounds you gravitate toward
in your production gives the album a
feeling of having one foot grounded in
reality and one foot floating in space.
why do you think there’s value in music
that extends into the abstract?</p>
    <p>i’m glad that feeling comes across. it is a really
important part of the storytelling on the album
- the worldly and otherworldly coexisting or
colliding is what happens in the story! i think
it also expresses the dissonance i often feel
between the cosmic truths/love and the
constraints and cruelty of the material world and
its oppressive/bureaucratic systems and such.</p>
    <p>BEHOLD THE ORB is largely about dreams and
grand visions of what the world can be without
appealing to existing authority or hegemony,
and this grandeur and connection to the
abstract and cosmic aims to counter defenses
that authority and bastions of the status quo
use. too often ‘common sense’ and ‘logic’ are
weaponised and argued for as the epitome
of truth while dismissing the intuitive and the
power of creativity, compassion and dreams.
a lot of people think that we can’t change the
world because their rules and visions are based
only upon what is already dominant, not what
is possible.</p>
    <p class="large" style="color:#7e97b8;">the title of this issue is “realms
of freedom.” do you find that creating
music gives you access to a realm of
freedom?</p>
    <p>definitely. i feel that i am able to create new
realities rather than just participate in existing
ones, which is especially important when the
dominant realities aren’t rooted in important
things like freedom or equality. it’s about creating
places i can exist within where i can be as weird,
playful and true as i want to be. hopefully my
realms end up being important to others too,
and can extend beyond symbolism, allowing
people to return to truth beyond the walls, to
relinquish their internal compliance to rules
which aren’t rooted in truth.</p>
